1. First we set the text __color__ to transparent. [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)
* testing
2. Then we add a dark __background-color__.
3. Then by adding __background-clip: text__ it only shows the background within the outline of the text. Itâ€™s like a mask. Note, this is not a standard feature and only implemented in Chrome/Safari.
4. And finally, if we add a bright, half transparent __text-shadow__ on top and push it down a bit so that the dark background can be seen, it makes it look like the text is carved into the surface.
